**Read email instructions carefully**
E-mail attachment are in the project. Get familiar with the design.

Notice the missing page that you have to style yourself. Check the email to know what the page should contain. If you need some inspiration search contact or about page designs on Google. Instead of owners, you can put your hackathon team members.

## Checkpoint 1: Create a team, divide the work

1. Create a team of two people and choose a team name capturing your team's spirit.
2. One of you submits your team name + members names on Slack in a comment.
3. Go through the project requirements and make sure you understand the product you are going to create.
4. To find out the font families and font sizes, open the provided PSD file. You can use any editor such as Photoshop or go for the online editor Photopea and open the file there.
5. Sketch and maybe even write a summary of everything you need to do.
6. Create a basic layout together then split the work. Each person should be responsible for one or more pages of the web.

## Checkpoint 2: Setup the project

1. Choose a GitHub account to house your project. Create a project called 'generic-hipster-coffee' on your GitHub.
2. Submit your GitHub project URL on Slack (your team name + GitHub URL)
3. Clone the project to each one of your teammate's computers.
4. Setup the project by running `npm install`.
5. Commit and push the working setup to your repo so you can always return to it if something goes terribly wrong.
6. Choose your git cooperation strategy. We recommend using feature branches.
7. Let each person create the HTML pages they are responsible for.

## Checkpoint 3: HTML + Styling

1. Create the required website using HTML + SCSS.

## Checkpoint 4: The project is done

1. Test your site in different browsers and screen sizes.

## EXTRA Checkpoint 5: Further styling and editing the "missing page"

1. You have already checked the email to know what the page should contain. However, you might want to make the page more interesting - add a contact form, information on your team members, a styled section with the story of the business, or anything else. If you need some inspiration search contact or about page designs on Google. Keep in mind this is an extra task - only do it if you have already fully achieved checkpoints 1-4.

## EXTRA Checkpoint 6: The ultimate design

1. Add an individual page for each of the products. Make a navigation bar for the products.
2. Check your project is responsive for all the different devices. HINT: Add a CSS transition into your team photos so the text appears over each person. Make the cursor pointer into the button and products.

## FINAL Checkpoint

1. No matter how many previous steps you have accomplished, make sure whatever you intend to present to the client works!
2. If something doesn't work, make sure you know about it in advance and are ready to address it in case the client notices.

### Follow these guidelines to avoid common mistakes

* Start with **analyzing** the data you have received.
* **Sketch** and maybe even **write a summary** of everything you need to do.
* Create a basic layout together then split the work.
* **Commit early, push often.**
* **Always PULL from remote before merging!!!** If you forget to do it, your branches will diverge and you'll have to merge them. We will have to come to your rescue.
* **Try to avoid editing the same file by two people.** If you do this, you will need to solve a lot of conflicts.
* Use command line for **doing** things in git, use GUI tools (gitk) only for **looking**.
* Adjust your plan throughout the day, the site must be presentable to the client in time (not everything needs to 100% especially if it's not visual).
* Have fun, take breaks, don't forget to eat and drink, don't push yourselves too hard.
